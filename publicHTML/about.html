                <h2>It Me!</h2>
                <p>Sean Kirkpatrick (he/him) is a Vietnamese-American queer anti-capitalist anarchist from Ohio.  He moved to Portland, OR in 2008, ignorant of the deeply racist history of the state, but excited by the coffee shops and bicycle infrastructure.  His interests vary from rock climbing and guitar playing to folding origami and cultivating bonsai.  With a software career ranging from industrial HMI and database development to scientific instrument firmware prototyping, he is much more a jack-of-all-trades than a specialist.</p>

                <h2>Software Tools</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Unity 2020.2+ - The do basically everything engine for multiple platforms.  I considered godot (because I’m primarily interested in making 2d games) and Unreal Engine (because it’s so goddamn beautiful), but Unity has better licensing for my expected level of sales (that is, not very much)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Packages:

                                <ul>
                                    Cinemachine - a huge improvement over the native camera.

                                    Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
                                    https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.2/manual/index.html
                                    2D Tilemap

                                    AstarPathfindingProject
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    
                    <li>Visual Studio 2019.  My primary coding environment</li>
                    <li>Github - basically using it as an online backup.  if I can manage all static pages, I may use GithubPages for the game’s website
                        <ul>
                            <li>right now I’m committing everything to Master, because I’m a monster</li>
                            <li>will be useful for bug tracking and organizing releases for different platforms</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Google Docs</li>
                    <li>Asana - for when I bother to scope things for this “just for fun” project that has ballooned…</li>
                    <li>Lucidchart - I really like the lucidchart tools and use it to sketch flow diagrams, mostly.</li>
                    <li>ProMotion NG - explicitly designed for pixel art, this is a good and powerful, but clunky program.  It’s easy to export into sprite sheets, the animation workflow is solid, and the palette system is great (though really weird and clunky getting used to).  works well with a stylus (I use a Huion Kanvas 16)</li>
                </ol>
