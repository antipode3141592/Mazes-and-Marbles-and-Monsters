            <p>Marbles, Monsters, &amp; Mazes is a top-down, physics-based action puzzler with retro 16-bit style.  It is my most developed game project to date, and this site is for sharing my progress.  The site looks like a potato currently, but I will get around to styling it...  probably.</p>

            <p>Making progress on the Quick Access system.  I created a simple container class, InventorySlot, that I can create a List of for tracking inventory items.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-csharp">
                        public class InventorySlot
                        {
                            public ItemStatsBase ItemStats;
                            public int Quantity;
                            public bool IsAvailable;
                            public int QuickAccessSlot;  //0-index for quick access slots, negative indicates no assignment

                            public string Id => ItemStats.Id;

                            public InventorySlot(ItemStatsBase itemStats, int quantity = 1, bool isAvailable = true, int quickAccessSlot = -1)
                            {
                                ItemStats = itemStats;
                                Quantity = quantity;
                                IsAvailable = isAvailable;
                                QuickAccessSlot = quickAccessSlot;
                            }
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Currently, the code uses LINQ to query the InventoryList for specific Ids, but that may get updated to a Dictionary with the ID as the key, or even a database.  Will worry about making it faster later (if performance needs improvement).</p>
                <p>The next functionality to add is a click-and-drag system for assigning quick slot items/abilities in an inventory popup.  Also, the inventory popup.  </p>
